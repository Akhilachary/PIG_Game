# PIG_Game
This is a Python-based PIG dice game where 2-4 players compete to reach a score of 20. Players roll a dice, accumulating points unless they roll a 1, which resets their turn score. The player can choose to continue rolling or hold their score. The game ends when a player reaches or exceeds 20 points.
